      <h2 className='mt-6'>Welcome to the Invoicing Guide produced by Invoice-Generator.com</h2>
      <p className='mt-2'>Take advantage of our free and secure invoice template to create professional invoices in one click. This guide is intended for those who are just getting started with invoicing.</p>
      <h1 className='mt-6'>So what is an invoice, anyway?</h1>
      <p className='mt-2'>An invoice is a bill for products or services rendered. By creating and sending a invoice, you are recording the fact that you provided a product or service and someone owes you payment for it.</p>
      <h1 className='mt-6'>Why do I need invoices?</h1>
      <p className='mt-2'>If the product or service you’re selling isn’t paid in full up front, you need a formal way to request payment from your customer. You also need a way to keep track of payments due from specific customers. Invoices meet both these business needs.</p>
